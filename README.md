# YouTube Video Grid Viewer

This project is a simple web application that allows users to create a custom grid of YouTube videos by pasting URLs. Users can add any YouTube link, including live streams, to view multiple videos simultaneously in a grid layout. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. It's a convenient tool for curating and watching several YouTube videos at once.
